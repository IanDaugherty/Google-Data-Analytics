Creating a framework to work with as a data analyst. The exacts steps in the process may change, but the flow of asking a questing, obtaining, cleaning, and analyzing data, and interpreting results remains constant.

Planning a project involves; deciding what questions to ask and what type of data that requires; how collecting the data would ideally look and how to manage it once gathered; what type of analysis will be done and what that requires; what to do with the results and data once the project is completed.

1​. Data life cycle:
- Plan
- Capture
- Manage
- Analyze
- Archive
- Destroy

2​. Data analysis process:
- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act

A problem is an obstacle to be solved, an issue is a topic to investigate, and a question is designed to discover information.

# <a name="decisions">Ask Questions to make Data-Driven Decisions</a>
## The Six Steps of Data Analysis 
### Step 1: Ask
It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is.
- Define the problem you’re trying to solve 
- Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations
- Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
- Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
- Take a step back and see the whole situation in context
Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
1. What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
2. Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

### Step 2: Prepare 
You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide: 

- What metrics to measure
- Locate data in your database
- Create security measures to protect that data
Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
1. What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
2. What research do I need to do?

### Step 3: Process
Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:

- Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data 
- Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
- Removing repeated entries
- Checking as much possible for bias in the data
Questions to ask yourself in this step: 
1. What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
2. How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?

### Step 4: Analyze 
You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to: 

- Perform calculations
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Create tables with your results
Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. What story is my data telling me?
2. How will my data help me solve this problem?
3. Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?

### Step 5: Share
Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data viz tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team:  

- Make better decisions
- Make more informed decisions
- Lead to stronger outcomes
- Successfully communicate your findings
Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
2. What would help me understand this if I were the listener?

### Step 6: Act
Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use. This could mean providing your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (step 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

These six steps can help you to break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called structured thinking. This process involves four basic activities:

1. Recognizing the current problem or situation
2. Organizing available information 
3. Revealing gaps and opportunities
4. Identifying your options

#### Data analysts typically work with six problem types

## S.M.A.R.T Questions
![SMART](images/LVRgU3jYTomUYFN42N6JxA_3bf2e40d79bd4afdb998eadc80bf5d33_Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-9.45.07-AM.png)
What features do people look for when buying a new car?
- Specific: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?
- Measurable: Does the question include a feature rating system?
- Action-oriented: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?
- Relevant: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?
- Time-bound: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years?

## Structured Thinking
Carefully defining the problem before jumping into analysis saves time by having a clear list of what you are expected to deliver, a timeline for major tasks and activities, and checkpoints for progress. A scope of work is an industry common practice that allows us the outline a project to allow everyone involved to have an idea of what is expected. Clarifying requirements and setting expectactions are two of the most important parts of a projects. Preparing to write an SOW is about asking questions to learn the necessary information about the project, but it’s also about clarifying and defining what you’re being asked to accomplish, and what the limits or boundaries of the “ask” are. 


#### Common pieces of a SOW

Deliverables: What work is being done, and what things are being created as a result of this project. Avoid vague statements and be specific. 

Milestones: Closely related to a timeline. How do you know when a given part of the project is considered complete. They can be entire tasks or stages or a process. 

Timeline: A way of mapping progress on a project so that all parties involved can know how long each step of the process should take, and when will the deliverables be completed.

Reports: How and how often will you update stakeholders on the status of the project. 

## Staying Objective

Numbers don’t mean much without context, but context is based on an individuals experience. Maintaining an unbiased view as much as possible is necessary for the integrity of the project. 

Context is the condition in which something exists or happens. Context is important in data analytics because it helps you sift through huge amounts of disorganized data and turn it into something meaningful. The fact is, data has little value if it is not paired with context. 

Context can turn raw data into meaningful information. It is very important for data analysts to contextualize their data. This means giving the data perspective by defining it. To do this, you need to identify:

- Who: The person or organization that created, collected, and/or funded the data collection
- What: The things in the world that data could have an impact on
- Where: The origin of the data
- When: The time when the data was created or collected
- Why: The motivation behind the creation or collection
- How: The method used to create or collect it

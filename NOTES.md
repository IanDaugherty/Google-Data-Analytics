![Data analysis process](images\Data-analysis-process.png)

Creating a framework to work with as a data analyst. The exacts steps in the process may change, but the flow of asking a questing, obtaining, cleaning, and analyzing data, and interpreting results remains constant.

Planning a project involves; deciding what questions to ask and what type of data that requires; how collecting the data would ideally look and how to manage it once gathered; what type of analysis will be done and what that requires; what to do with the results and data once the project is completed.

1​. Data life cycle:
- Plan
- Capture
- Manage
- Analyze
- Archive
- Destroy

2​. Data analysis process:
- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act

A problem is an obstacle to be solved, an issue is a topic to investigate, and a question is designed to discover information.
